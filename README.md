ScintillaNET-Kitchen is an application that not only demonstrates how Scintilla works, but it also (and most importantly) helps you with designing how scintilla should look like.

Requirements
------------

Thi software requires .NET 4.0 (Client Profile) and the ScintillaNET NuGet package, so nothing much to do from your side.
